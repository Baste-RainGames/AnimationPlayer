- means "should do"
* means "working on RIGHT THE FUCK NOW"

Animation states:
    - Have the states get a GUID rather than an index, to support reordering and stuff better.
    - Different kinds of states:
        * blend trees
            - Nested!
            * 2D (almost finished, need to implement the good algo!)
        - flows (state A into state B into state C, etc.)
            - this can be used to change into a specific idle state after standing still. Or other stuff!
        - random (bunch of states, selects a random one when you enter)
    - Check if it's possible to loop/not loop in the state, and how expensive that is compared to the native (stupid) way of doing it
    + Add support for dragging animation clips over the list of states to generate a new state
        - Also add support for dragging in the .fbx or .blend or whatever (ModelImporter), and add all clips in it
        - If you drag in several, create a "Do you want to add many clips or blend tree" popup
    * Preview (oh my!)
        + preview for single-clip states
        + preview for other kinds of states
        - allow for setting blend vars on previews
        - previews for transitions
        - make sure the time slider gives the actual animation time! Now it's going to desynchronize (although the relative value is good)
    - Animation events!
        - Make own tab for animation events
        - Define API. 
            - Dependency on SerializedAction? That makes it not possible to have the player as an asset.
            - SendMessage? Not very clean in general, but it matches what an animation event is, so it's probably okay.
            - Allow both?
        - Make sure events are called
        - Make settings:
            - min blend factor - default to 0. Only call the event if the current blend factor is larger than this
            - Play only first/repeat. If the animation loops, do we want this to happen every time, or just the first one?
    - Make it possible to play an animation relative to the current position. This will make Unity-created animations for eg. doors be a _LOT_ easier.

Animation transitions:
    - Transition-by-clip:
        If you're transitioning from A to B, specify a clip C so the transition is A->C->B.
        This will be usefull for run-stops and such.
        Have to figure out if C here is a clip, another state in the state view, or another state in a special view.
    - Several ways of transitioning between two states
        probably want default transition and named transition
    
    - Move the transitions to the states?
        -I'm note sure about this. It would require less bookkeeping when deleting/reordering states (deleting a state would auto-delete
         all transitions from that state), but some bookkeeping will always be neccessary. Keeping the transitions seperate also makes
         them easier to iterate, which is nice.

Misc
    - Make the cached values in the editor be per-layer where appropriate (selected from/to state for transitions)
    - Make a caching system that doesn't depend on EditorPrefs? Cluttering the registry is an ugly hack.
    - Add re-order support to things? Or better view for states
    - Metadata:
        - list all transitions (with go-to buttons)
        + list all fbx/.anim files referenced
        + list all clips used
        - list all blend variables
        - make sure all of these lists update when stuff is added. On changing tab is not enough, could have two inspectors open
    - fix the parts of the window shifting around as you unfold stuff (like clips used in metadata)
        - THAT STOPPED HAPPENING?
