- means "should do"
* means "working on RIGHT THE FUCK NOW"

Animation states:
    - Different kinds of states:
        - blend trees
            * 2D
                - Nested!
            - 3D
        - flows (state A into state B into state C, etc.)
            - this can be used to change into a specific idle state after standing still. Or other stuff!
        - random (bunch of states, selects a random one when you enter)
    - Check if it's possible to loop/not loop in the state, and how expensive that is compared to the native (stupid) way of doing it
    - Some way of adding a bunch from a file at the same time!
    - Preview (oh my!)
    - Animation events! Of some sort!

Animation transitions:
    - Transition-by-clip:
        If you're transitioning from A to B, specify a clip C so the transition is A->C->B.
        This will be usefull for run-stops and such.
        Have to figure out if C here is a clip, another state in the state view, or another state in a special view.
    - Several ways of transitioning between two states
        probably want default transition and named transition
    - Move the transitions to the states?

Misc
    - Add "Are you sure" to all of the delete buttons
    - Make the cached values in the editor be per-layer where appropriate (selected from/to state for transitions)
    - Add reorder support to things? Or better view for states
    - Scroll views!
    - Metadata:
        - list all transitions (with go-to buttons)
        - list all fbx/.anim files referenced
        - list all clips used
        - list all blend variables
        - etc?
