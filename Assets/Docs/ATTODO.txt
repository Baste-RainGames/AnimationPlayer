Animation states:
    - Different kinds of states:
        * blend trees
            - Nested!
            * 2D (almost finished, need to implement the good algo!)
        - flows (state A into state B into state C, etc.)
            - this can be used to change into a specific idle state after standing still. Or other stuff!
        - random (bunch of states, selects a random one when you enter)
    - Check if it's possible to loop/not loop in the state, and how expensive that is compared to the native (stupid) way of doing it
    + Add support for dragging animation clips over the list of states to generate a new state
        - Also add support for dragging in the .fbx or .blend or whatever (ModelImporter), and add all clips in it
        - If you drag in several, create a "Do you want to add many clips or blend tree" popup
    - Preview (oh my!)
    - Animation events! Of some sort!
    - Make it possible to play an animation relative to the current position. This will make Unity-created animations for eg. doors be a _LOT_ easier.

Animation transitions:
    - Transition-by-clip:
        If you're transitioning from A to B, specify a clip C so the transition is A->C->B.
        This will be usefull for run-stops and such.
        Have to figure out if C here is a clip, another state in the state view, or another state in a special view.
    - Several ways of transitioning between two states
        probably want default transition and named transition
    - Move the transitions to the states?

Misc
    - Make the cached values in the editor be per-layer where appropriate (selected from/to state for transitions)
    - Add re-order support to things? Or better view for states
    - Metadata:
        - list all transitions (with go-to buttons)
        - list all fbx/.anim files referenced
        + list all clips used
        - list all blend variables
        - make sure all of these lists update when stuff is added. On changing tab is not enough, could have two inspectors open
    - fix the parts of the window shifting around as you unfold stuff (like clips used in metadata)
